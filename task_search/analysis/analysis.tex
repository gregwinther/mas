    \section{Formalism}

    We define a search $A$ as an area bound by two points. Over the search area, 
    $n_T$ tasks $T$ are spawned at random positions. The tasks have a task capacity
    $T_c$ indicating how many agents $R$ are required to solve a task. The task is 
    solved immeadeately if $T_c$ agents are within the task radius $T_r$.
    The agents $R$ move randomly around the search area at a speed $R_v$. There are 
    $n_R$ agents. When an agent is inside the task radius $T_r$ of a task, the agents 
    will wat for other agents to complete the task. The agents can also call for 
    aid in solving a task. The communication distance $R_d$ determines how 
    far an agent can send a call for aid to another agent.
    

    \section{Simulations}

    We implement a tool for visualising the problem described above, in `PyGame'.
    The full implementation is available at \url{github.com/gregwinther/mas}.
