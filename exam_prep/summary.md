# 9: Swarm Robotics 1

## What is swarm robotics?

There is no explicit definition of a _swarm_ in literature.
A swarm is defined via its behavior.

The _size of a swarm_ is defined by what it is not: 
"not as large as to be dealt with statistical averages" and
"not as small as to be dealt with as a few-body problem".
The size of a swarm $N$ is 
$$
    10^2 < N << 10^23,
$$
not Avagadro-large.

Swarm robotics is "the study of how a large number of 
relatively simple physically embodied agents can be 
designed such that a desired collective behavior
emerges from local interactions among agents and 
between agents and the environment", according 
to Dorigo and Sahin. But! A swarm is not necessarily

There are some key features. The fact that local 
interactions between agents and the environment should
be possible requires robots to have local sensing and 
probably also communication capabilities. In fact, 
(local) communication is considered a key feature of
swarms.

Collaboration is required to go beyond a mere 
paralllisation in swarm a swarm system. We want 
to go beyond the performance of simple parallelisation.
Think of some a clearning task with each robot 
cleaning a small assigned area.

## Swarm performance.

## Modelling swarms as a series of mappings.

## When are rate equations appropriate?

## The Langevin equation.

## The Focker-Planck equation.
